###### Creativity test and rewarding
Two characteristics are usually attributed to creativity: *novelty* and *functionality.* Beyond this 
the opinions of researchers into creativity typically differ and thus it is difficult to form a co-
herent overall picture of the current state of research into creativity. 
This thesis first reviews the variety of ways to *define*, *verify* and *classify* creativity and com-
pares them to each other. Subsequently, the thesis focuses on **divergent thinking**, which is 
initially defined in terms of *psychometric psychology* and also contrasted with its counterpart, 
**convergent thinking**. *Divergent thinking* is a thought process used to generate creative ideas 
by exploring many possible solutions. *Convergent thinking* is oriented towards deriving the 
single best answer to a clearly defined question. Divergent thinking is associated with creativity as an important part of the field, although it is not sufficient for creative performance. This paper focuses on divergent thinking as a variety of tests have been developed to measure 
it. 
Divergent thinking tests are often called creativity tests, even though they do not actually 
measure creativity. The Alternative Uses Task (AUT) is one of the most popular. In AUT examinees are asked to list as many possible uses for a common household item. 
Scoring is comprised of four components: **fluency**, **flexibility**, **originality** and **elaboration**. AUT is not the 
most accurate and precise creativity test, but it is easy to administer and score and it does 
not require any training. 
Dozens of studies have examined the effect of reward on creativity. Despite a sizable literature, the question of whether rewards enhance or hinder creativity remains controversial. 
Ample evidence has been cited to support both positions, as the results of studies examining 
the relationship between rewards and creativity have been inconsistent. Much insight can be 
derived from existing studies on rewards and creativity, although more work needs to be done 
to further what is known about how and when rewards affect creativity. 
In this thesis Guilford’s AUT is used to examine the effect of rewards and requests for original 
responses on divergent thinking. The results show that rewards increased fluency and flexibility when examinees were not requested to be original. Rewards and requests for original responses decreased the level of performance to a lower than without rewards. The results of this research raise new questions. 
Guilford’s AUT is a good tool to measure creativity, and it can be recommended for use in 
future studies. The thesis concludes with some suggestions for practical arrangements for 
such research.
